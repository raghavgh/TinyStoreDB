	Short: "TinyStoreDB CLI - Interact with your lightweight key-value database",
	Long: `TinyStoreDB is a lightweight, embeddable key-value database built in Go. 
It supports fast disk-based persistence with optional TTL-based expiry and concurrency-safe operations.

This CLI tool lets you set, get, and delete keys, configure your connection, and inspect metrics.

Example usage:
  tinystoredb set mykey myvalue
  tinystoredb get mykey
  tinystoredb delete mykey

	// has an action associated with it:
	// Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) { },
}

// Execute adds all child commands to the root command and sets flags appropriately.
// This is called by main.main(). It only needs to happen once to the rootCmd.

	// will be global for your application.

	// rootCmd.PersistentFlags().StringVar(&cfgFile, "config", "", "config file (default is $HOME/.tinystoredb.yaml)")

	// Cobra also supports local flags, which will only run
	// when this action is called directly.
