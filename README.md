# 🚀 TinyStoreDB

**TinyStoreDB** is a lightweight, persistent key-value storage system built as a learning project. It provides basic operations to store and retrieve string-based key-value pairs using an append-only storage model.

## 🔮 Roadmap

🚧 Future releases will focus on enhancing the database with the following features:

- ✅ Update and Delete Operations:  
  Enable modification and removal of existing key-value pairs.
- 🚀 Optimized Read Performance:  
  Implementing indexing mechanisms for faster lookups.
- 🔒 Concurrency Handling:  
  Ensuring safe operations across multiple clients.
