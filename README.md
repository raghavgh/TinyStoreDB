# 🚀 TinyStoreDB

**TinyStoreDB** is a lightweight, persistent key-value storage system built as a learning project. It provides basic operations to store and retrieve string-based key-value pairs using an append-only storage model.  
⚠️ **Note:** This project is still in progress and **not ready for production use.**
---

## ✨ Features

- 🗂️ Persistent Storage:  
  Data is stored in a `.bin` file format for durability.
- 🔑 Simple Key-Value API:  
  Supports storing and retrieving string-based key-value pairs.
- ⚡ Append-Only Design:  
  Efficient writes with a sequential append approach.
- 🛠️ GOB Encoding:  
  Utilizes Go's GOB encoding for flexible data serialization.

## 📁 Data Storage Format

Each key-value entry is stored in the following format:

1. 📏 Length of the data (4 bytes) – Specifies the total size of the stored data.
2. 🏷️ Encoded data type (variable size) – Determined by Go's GOB encoding.
3. 🗃️ Actual data (variable size) – The encoded key or value.

Both keys and values are stored using this format, ensuring consistency in data retrieval.

## 🛠️ Installation

Ensure you have Go 1.23 or later installed on your system.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:raghavgh/TinyStoreDB.git
cd TinyStoreDB
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
go mod tidy
```

## 👨🏻‍💻 Usage

To get started with TinyStoreDB, follow the example below:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "client"
)

func main() {
    db := client.NewTinyStoreDBClient()
    
    // Store key-value pair
    db.Set("exampleKey", "exampleValue")

    // Retrieve value
    value := db.Get("exampleKey")
    fmt.Println("Retrieved Value:", value)
}
```

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- ❌ Limited Data Type Support:  
  Currently supports only string keys and values.

- 🛑 No Update or Delete Operations:  
  The current version does not support modifying or removing key-value pairs.

- 🐢 Sequential Reads:  
  Get operations iterate over the entire file, which may impact performance as data grows.

---

## 🔮 Roadmap

🚧 Future releases will focus on enhancing the database with the following features:

- ✅ Update and Delete Operations:  
  Enable modification and removal of existing key-value pairs.
- 🚀 Optimized Read Performance:  
  Implementing indexing mechanisms for faster lookups.
- 🔒 Concurrency Handling:  
  Ensuring safe operations across multiple clients.
